        <div class="gameTitle">Eternal Lie</div>
        <div class="lieDesc">This is a game of Eldritch Evil and abomination. You play as West, someone driven to power. What won't you do to find the favor of the Elder Gods? Mechanically, this is a semi-idle incremental about a person building a cult of personality and sacrificing them to achieve personal power.</div>
        <div id='warning'>Warning: Themes include but are not limited to: grave robbing, murder, castration, trepanation, gaslighting, delusion, drug and alcohol use, breeding pits, sacrifice to the Old Gods, and in one version AI Art (gasp!). If any of the above are deal breakers, you might want to consider another game, perhaps Kittens Game. I love Kittens Game.</div>

                <div class="lieDesc">From here I will pick one version to finish based on player response. I plan to add rituals as temporary modifiers and material purchases of various kinds like golden robes. There will be a third reset mechanic which alters the game more than the previous two, an achievements page and a bookshelf for the Tomes collected. Last I will endeavor to build a leaderboard or something so players can compare stats and try to make a satisfying final ending.</div>
